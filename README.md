A simple web application, created as my first fully working ASP.NET Core project.

<p>
This one is pretty minimalistic. The main focus of this project was getting used to the framework, therefore I didn't really focuse on the front side of this application.
User is able to create new entry and to display all of them. Nothing special but hey, it works!
